This project was a simple KV Store that I had a lot of trouble with in the first place. I had a lot of areas when I was starting, from things as simple as 
how to send a message between the server in the client, to parsing the message. I also had a significant amount of trouble with the creation of the driver file,
as I have never had to do something like that before. One of the things I am most proud if is how I was able to have the clients be able to disconnect from the server
through a disconnect message. The way I have been running my code is to first start the server in a seperate window, then run Alice mpy and then Bob.py. The packages I use are
OS, Threading,Time,and Socket. I use multithreading on the server and in the Driver.py

These are the cases that get tested in my KV store.
1) Storing a KV pair.
2) Getting a KV Pair.
3) Storing multiple KV pairs at once.
4) Getting multiple KV Pairs at once.
5) Overwriting a Value in a KV Pair.
6) Trying to get a Value when the key does not exits. (once and then multiple times in a row)

Here is a log after running Alice.py

PS C:\Users\GeeBa\Documents\iugithub\DistSys> & C:/Users/GeeBa/anaconda3/python.exe c:/Users/GeeBa/Documents/iugithub/DistSys/Server.py
Starting server
keys after alice stores: 
{'key': 'ADifferentValue', 'password': 'Longsword', 'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2', 'key3': 'value3', 'key4': 'value4'}

Here is a log for the terminal running the clients

GeeBa@DESKTOP-KTN22LB MINGW64 ~/Documents/iugithub/DistSys (main)
$ python Alice.py

GeeBa@DESKTOP-KTN22LB MINGW64 ~/Documents/iugithub/DistSys (main)
$ python Bob.py
key:ADifferentValue
password:Longsword
username: Key Value Pair does not exist
key1:value1
key2:value2
key3:value3
key4:value4
key5: Key Value Pair does not exist
key6: Key Value Pair does not exist
key7: Key Value Pair does not exist
key8: Key Value Pair does not exist



If you run driver.py, you should recieve the following output:

PS C:\Users\GeeBa\Documents\iugithub\DistSys> & C:/Users/GeeBa/anaconda3/python.exe c:/Users/GeeBa/Documents/iugithub/DistSys/Driver.py
